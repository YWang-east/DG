Outlook
=======

The code is still in an early stage of development. The following list gives an overview of possible future developments:

- Adapt the code to 2D and 3D
- Expand models, flux solvers and time integration methods
- Provide an input file for frequently changed parameters.
- Provide an interface to external mesh generators, such as Gmesh.
- Generalize data output, e.g., write ``vtk`` files instead of ``csv``.
- Parallelization with MPI.
